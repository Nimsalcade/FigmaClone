# Figma Clone MVP

A lightweight design tool prototype built with React, Fabric.js, and Zustand.

## Development

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev` (defaults to http://localhost:5173).

## Exporting the Canvas

Use the **Export PNG** button in the top bar to capture a snapshot of the currently visible viewport. The export respects your current zoom and pan, renders at the active device pixel ratio, and defaults to a transparent background so the on-screen grid remains purely a layout aid.
